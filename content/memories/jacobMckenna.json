    "Alex and I spent every moment we could together and it was usually spent competing. Alex was the best of competitors. We would play sports for hours, whether it was soccer at my house, or flag football at his. When he wasn't able to play sports as much we found other ways to compete. Card games, Magic the Gathering, video games, etc. It was never about winning for him. He just loved competing and giving it his all. Win or lose we were going again. Alex also loved music. I remember sitting in the office scrolling through song after song to find the best ones. He was always so excited to show me the new songs he discovered. 100% of my taste in music stems from these moments. It's hard to do anything without having a flashback where Alex has impacted my life. Just the other day I taught my son Preston Alex's signature soccer move. Ollie's (my 2nd son) baseball walk up song is \"Remember the Name\" by Fort Minor. I still remember Alex showing me that song for the first time. Jaxson's (my 3rd son) middle name is Alex, and he will one day be so proud of who he is named after. My wife and kids have never met Alex, but they all know who he is and how much he means to me. Others see us as the closest of friends, but I think of him as my brother and I couldn't be more proud."
