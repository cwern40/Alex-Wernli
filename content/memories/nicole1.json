    "I remember when I had my appendix out, he was my only sibling to visit me in the hospital, and he brought me flowers! When I got home, he hung out with me in my room while I recovered. I remember sitting on the couch, helping him e-mail his missionary friends and finding and texting jokes to everyone when he got too weak to do it by himself. I was singing in the choir that was performing at the General Young Women's meeting. One week before he passed away, he came to my choir practice. He was very weak; this was the last time that he went out of the house before he passed away. This was a very spiritual experience for everyone there."
