    "Alex is one of the most incredible people I have ever known. He was quick with a joke, and loved to laugh. He was also hilarious, so he made everyone around him laugh all the time too. I hung around the Wernli house a lot, which I feel bad about now. They probably were very sick of me, but it was just the funnest place to be. Every Wernli sibling became part of a second family for me. Anna is my age, so I knew her best, but then I grew to love every single one of those kids. We had so much fun. (Sorry about the Sharpie wars, Linda. üò¨) One of my favorite memories of Alex is sitting at the Wernli family computer and sharing new music with each other we found on iTunes. Sev, Anberlin, Sum41, those bands will ALWAYS remind me of my sweet friend Alex. I made an Alex playlist with all of our old favorite songs that I listen to in the car a lot. My kids know about Alex. They know his birthday, June 1st. It's Alex day in our house. I miss him every day. The times I had terrorizing the Wernli family for the years of 2007 - 2009 are still some of the best memories of my life. Sadly, I do not have a single photo of us together. I do have several letters from him that he wrote me through the years, and I cherish them. I'm so grateful I got to know him personally and call him my friend.‚ù§Ô∏è"
