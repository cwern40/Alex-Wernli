    "I have so many wonderful memories of Alex. I love that kid! This one always makes me think of him. Whenever I would make Eggplant Parmesan my boys were not thrilled. One day they asked if Alex could stay for dinner, I informed Alex that he was welcome to join us but we were having Eggplant Parmesan, he said he was willing to try it. Turns out he loved it and gave my boys a hard time about not liking it. Whenever I made it we would invite Alex to eat with us. Now whenever I make it or eat it I always think of Alex."
