    "Alex was a very busy boy who loved to be outside and play sports. As a toddler, he was fearless of water; while still in diapers, his favorite thing to do was to jump off the diving board. He played t-ball, basketball, football, and soccer. Soccer was his favorite, especially playing on a competitive team. Alex was always very thoughtful of others. While driving to Salt Lake for treatments, we spent hours talking and listening to his favorite music, which was original old rock and roll, then, because of his service mission, Christian music."
