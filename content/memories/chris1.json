    "I remember growing up being the best of friends. We always did everything together: Legos, video games, watching movies, sports, and staying up late talking in our room. I remember one time we were so excited to watch one of the new Bourne movies. We could not understand a word, thinking that it was because it was taking place in a different country. Alex fell asleep 1/4 of the way through. Then, about 1/2 of the way through, I realized that the DVD player had been playing in French. I woke Alex up and told him. We just went to bed and then watched it the next day."
