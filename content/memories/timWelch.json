    "My recollection of the time I spent with Alex brings joy to my heart. The kind of joy that fills my soul with complete happiness while at the same time still fills my eyes with tears when I think how much I miss that sweet young man in my life. I served as his stake president from 2005 and I was released in 2014 after he passed away. The experience I had getting to know Alex will always be one of the most sweet and cherished blessings, not just in my service as a stake president, but in my life. It is a rare experience in life to meet a young man as courageous, thoughtful, funny, and smart, as Alex who influenced my life in such a profound way that even many years later I find myself grateful for what I learned from him about living the gospel and learning more fully what surrendering my will to God really looks like. Alex had his life ahead of him. Most of my life was behind me. He had plenty of reasons to complain about a “bad break”, or something which seemed unfair. I have heard others say those words and curse God in the process. Not Alex. For my part I could stand in front of a congregation at the Tabernacle and preach the sermon, Alex taught that sermon with magnificent power day after day with words I could never find, in ways I could never teach. The truth is, his life was the greatest sermon anyone could hear on the subject of loving God and following the example of Christ in surrendering his will completely to his Father in Heaven. That is a sermon I will never forget and it continues to inspire me each time I think of this Angelic friend I was honored to know and love. He will never be forgotten."
