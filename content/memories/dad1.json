    "Playing sports with my boys has always been fun for me. Alex would try to keep up with Chris and me, and he did a pretty good job. When it came to kicking balls, Alex ruled. I think what impressed me the most is Alex's courage. He faced his challenges with faith, knowing that whatever the outcome, things would be okay. He always thought of others before himself and did his best to support everyone in his family. He made caring for him easy and fun."
