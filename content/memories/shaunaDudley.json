    "Oh how I loved Alex and the light that shown so brightly through him. Harold and I were always amazed at how late the Wernli family stayed up. Whenever Harold would tease Alex about it he would respond “Just livin the dream”. It always made us laugh. Alex was such a positive person. I marvel and the way he handled each challenge. He was wise beyond his years. God had big plans for him. I cannot wait to see all that he has accomplished on the other side."
